# AoC2018
Personal code of 16 (out of 25) challenges in the AoC 2018.

Unfortunately I didn't manage to complete the challenge, but maybe in the future I'll uppdate the repo with the remaining 9.

For those who don't know this code challenge, go visit [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).

_WARNING_

The solutions are often not commented and probably always not optimal (in memory usage and execution time), I just wanted the algorithm to be correct, not efficient.

Anyway, I hope this will help.
